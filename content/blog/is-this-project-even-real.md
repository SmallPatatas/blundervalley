## Key points

* end of O'Leary's YT video "this is real" quote is an odd way to end a video
* (per max fawcett) most data centre companies prefer renewables
* high-profile investment firms are questioning the AI stock valuations, although 'bubbles can take time to pop'
* questions about the actual utility of GenAI/LLMs
* GenAI is losing billions of dollars per year
* even for the believers, the future seems to be smaller models
* Altman admitting that progress has slowed
* Exploratory work has only just begun; water license amount doesn't make sense
* Video on Wonder Valley website is full of weird stuff like people walking backwards, a cafeteria patron morphing into a different person, etc - does that seem like a serious $70B project?
* still unclear if the $70B is USD or CAD; both countries' news media reporting the same figure
* O'Leary seems to just be sucking up to Trump
* Currently also talking about buying TikTok
* O'Leary sees AI as a way to persecute young people
* gas power is currently more expensive than renewables
* 
* O'Leary could be just trying to get a better deal from ND or WV
