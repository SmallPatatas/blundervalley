## Too many things don't seem to add up about this project proposal. What game is Kevin O'Leary playing?

You'd think that someone who listens to business proposals all day would understand the art of persuasion, right? Take Kevin O'Leary, famous for being the 'mean guy' on Dragon's Den and Shark Tank, shows in which a clique of grumpy aristocrats solicit pitches from entrepreneurs, and respond with snap judgements about either purchasing a portion of the business owner's soul, or sadistically shattering their dreams for the viewing public's amusement. You might expect O'Leary to have a keen eye for 

## Key points

* end of O'Leary's YT video "this is real" quote is an odd way to end a video
* (per max fawcett) most data centre companies prefer renewables
* high-profile investment firms are questioning the AI stock valuations, although 'bubbles can take time to pop'
* questions about the actual utility of GenAI/LLMs
* GenAI is losing billions of dollars per year
* even for the believers, the future seems to be smaller models
* Altman admitting that progress has slowed
* Exploratory work has only just begun; water license amount doesn't make sense
* Video on Wonder Valley website is full of weird stuff like people walking backwards, a cafeteria patron morphing into a different person, etc - does that seem like a serious $70B project?
* still unclear if the $70B is USD or CAD; both countries' news media reporting the same figure
* O'Leary seems to just be sucking up to Trump
* Currently also talking about buying TikTok
* O'Leary sees AI as a way to persecute young people
* gas power is currently more expensive than renewables
* O'Leary could just be trying to build a Bitcoin mine
* O'Leary could be just trying to get a better deal from ND or WV
* So far, no consultation w/ First Nations; only a temp water license; no submissions to EAC(? see CBC article)
