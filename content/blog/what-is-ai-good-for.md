## Being a creep

* non-consensual pornography
* deepfakes, impersonation scams

## Lying, at scale

* disinformation at scale, narrative control
* spam
* AI 'slop' content
* hoaxes

## Screwing over working people

* bosses get to threaten workers with replacement
* stealing content from artists, writers, etc
* landlord collusion
* charging more for groceries
* denying insurance?

## Automating tasks

* coding
* malware
* medical diagnosis?
* making doctors distrust themeselves
* reducing # of doctors?
