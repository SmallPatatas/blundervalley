# About

<p>Kevin O'Leary is hyping up his proposal for a gargantuan $100 billion project he calls 'Wonder Valley': he wants to help build the world's largest AI data centre in Alberta. But there are a lot of things that don't make sense about the proposal.</p>

<p>This website is dedicated to looking beyond the marketing of this and other AI data centre projects, so that people can make an informed decision about whether to support the project, or oppose it.</p>
