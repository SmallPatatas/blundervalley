<h2>Kevin O'Leary says he wants to build a $70 billion AI data centre project in Northwestern Alberta.</h2>
<p>If fully built, it would be the largest data centre park on the planet. He calls it "Wonder Valley."</p>
<p>Other companies are starting to announce massive plans of their own. But should Canadians buy into the AI data centre hype, or are folks like Kevin O'Leary just trying to take advantage of us?</p>
<p>Are these projects good for people in the region? For Albertans? For Canadians? Or are they a massive waste of money and resources that only benefit a few people?</p>
<p>This site's mission is to look beyond the marketing buzzwords and press releases, in order to answer these questions and more.</p>
